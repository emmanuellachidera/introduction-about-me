
Normal HTML elements are generic elements that are used to structure and define the content of a web page. 
They do not convey any specific meaning or context about their content to search engines or assistive 
technologies. Examples of normal HTML elements include <div>, <span>, <p>, <b>, <i>, etc.

Semantic HTML elements, on the other hand, carry meaning and convey the purpose or role of the content 
they enclose. They provide additional information about the structure of the document to browsers, 
search engines, and assistive technologies, making the content more accessible and SEO-friendly. 
Examples of semantic HTML elements include <header>, <nav>, <section>, <article>, <footer>, <aside>, 
<main>, <figure>, <figcaption>, <time>, <address>, etc.

The disparity between closing tags and self-closing tags in HTML lies in how they are used to define 
elements:

Closing Tags: Most HTML elements require both opening and closing tags to encapsulate content. 
For example, <div> and <p> elements are typically opened with <div> or <p> and closed with </div> 
or </p> respectively. Closing tags are used to mark the end of an element and delineate its content.

Self-Closing Tags: Some HTML elements do not have any content within them and are self-contained. 
These elements can be defined using a single tag, which includes a slash before the closing angle bracket. 
For example, <img> and <br> are self-closing tags. They don't require a separate closing tag because they 
don't enclose any content. Instead, they represent standalone items like images or line breaks.

Inline elements and block elements are distinguished by how they behave in relation to other elements and 
how they are displayed:

Inline Elements: Inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary. 
They flow within the content and do not force a line break. Examples of inline elements include <span>, 
<a>, <strong>, <em>, <img>, <input>, <br>, etc.

Block Elements: Block elements, on the other hand, start on a new line and occupy the full width available 
to them, by default. They create a visual "block" of content on the page and often represent structural 
elements like paragraphs, headings, lists, and divs. Examples of block elements include <div>, <p>, <h1> 
to <h6>, <ul>, <ol>, <li>, <table>, <form>, etc.
